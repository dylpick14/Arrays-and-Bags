This project was part of my Data Structures class.
This was the first project in the class.
This project focuses on Arraylists or "Bags" in terms of the code.
The BagExtensionsTest.java and the BagInterface.java classes were given by the professor.
The ArrayBag.java had the default constructor and party of the overloaded constructor filled in by the professor. 
All functions under the commented area of "METHODS TO BE COMPLETED" are written by me.
1. Checking to see if two bags are equal to each other
2. Duplicate all entities in a bag
3. Remove all duplicate entities in a bag
